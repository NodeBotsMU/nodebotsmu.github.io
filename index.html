    <p>In recent years, we have seen a proliferation of processing devices that collect and manage information from their real-time environments via some physical interface component–among them, 
       anti-lock brakes, Mars rovers, tele-surgery, artificial limbs, and even iPods. 
       As these devices become ubiquitous, a liberally educated person should have some familiarity 
       with the ways in which such devices work–their capabilities and limitations.</p>
